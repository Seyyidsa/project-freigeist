# **FREIGEIST WEEKLY**

*Ideas, Observations, and Random Thoughts from the Road*

**KW 33, 2025 | The "Spontaneous Simplicity" Edition**

## **Opening Thought**

*"The biggest mistake I made in my life was not starting‚Äîevery time I didn't start something because I was afraid of other people's opinions, because it didn't fit some trend, or for any other reason, honestly."*

Sometimes the most profound weeks are the ones without elaborate plans or complex insights. This week I filmed spontaneously, without notes, without preparation‚Äîjust pure reflection on a week of simple foundations: work, sports, small experiments, and one powerful realization about the cost of hesitation.

The Freigeist knows that consistency in the basics often teaches more than complexity in the extraordinary.

## **What's Occupying My Mind**

**The Starting Revolution**
Hit me hard this week: How many things have I not tried simply because I was afraid of what others might think? How many experiments, projects, creative endeavors died before they began because they didn't fit current trends or expectations?

Every time I chose not to start, I chose certainty over possibility. And looking back, that feels like the biggest mistake pattern of my life.

**The VR Art Experiment**
Did something completely new: Put on VR goggles, made a 3D model transparent, and tried to paint what I saw on paper. The blend of digital and analog, virtual and real. It worked surprisingly well and opened up a whole new creative dimension I want to explore more.

## **This Week's Adventures**

üí™ **Daily Grind Excellence** - Work and sports every single day. Sometimes the most powerful adventures are the ones that happen in routine. Grateful for the discipline that's becoming automatic.

üé® **VR Painting Discovery** - First time experimenting with mixed reality art. Used VR to create a transparent 3D reference while painting traditionally. Technology meeting craft in unexpected ways.

üßπ **Balcony Revival** - Finally cleaned my balcony after way too long. Amazing how such a simple task completely transforms your relationship with a space. Now sitting outside feels like a reward instead of a reminder.

üì± **macOS Portfolio Inspiration** - Discovered a Cursa employee who built his personal website like macOS‚Äîcreating his own operating system as a portfolio. Sometimes the most inspiring ideas come from reimagining familiar interfaces.

üéµ **Ben's Musical Evolution** - Listened to Ben's new music. It's getting incredibly good, incredibly fast. There's something inspiring about watching someone find their flow and accelerate into mastery.

üìö **Kindle Casualty** - My Kindle died. Actually frustrating how dependent I've become on this little device for reading. Time to get a replacement and maybe reflect on digital dependency.

## **The Cost of Not Starting**

The realization that hit hardest: The biggest risk isn't failing at something you try. The biggest risk is never trying at all.

How many creative projects, business ideas, personal experiments, or simple curiosities have I killed before they could breathe? How many times did I choose the approval of people who probably weren't even paying attention over my own curiosity?

The Freigeist starts before they're ready. Because ready is a moving target that often never arrives.

## **Ideas That Sparked**

üé® **Mixed Reality Art Studio** - The VR painting experiment opened up possibilities. What if you could layer digital models, lighting, and references over traditional art tools? Technology as a creative partner, not replacement.

üíª **Personal OS Philosophy** - The macOS portfolio idea: What if our personal brands weren't websites but operating systems? Interactive, explorable, functional. Your personality as user interface.

üèÉ **Routine as Adventure** - Discovering that consistency in basics (work + sports daily) creates its own kind of high. Sometimes the most radical thing you can do is just show up every day.

## **What I'm Learning About Simplicity**

This week taught me that some of the best insights come from unplanned reflection. No elaborate consumption mapping, no complex pattern analysis‚Äîjust honest assessment of what happened and what it meant.

Sometimes the most powerful videos are the ones you make spontaneously. Sometimes the most important weeks are the ones without dramatic events. Sometimes progress looks like cleaning your balcony and showing up for your commitments.

*The Professional complicates. The Amateur just begins.*

## **Currently Consuming**

**Creating:** VR art experiments, mixing digital and analog creativity
**Inspiring:** Ben's rapid musical improvement and Cursa employee's OS portfolio
**Missing:** My dead Kindle and the reading rhythm it enabled
**Appreciating:** The simple satisfaction of daily work and exercise routine

## **Gratitude Check**

This week I'm grateful for:

- **Daily discipline** in work and sports that's becoming automatic
- **Small creative breakthroughs** like the VR painting experiment
- **Simple pleasures** like finally having a clean balcony to enjoy
- **Friends pursuing excellence** like Ben with his music evolution
- **The courage to film spontaneously** without perfect preparation

## **Three Things Worth Trying This Week**

1. **Start something you've been avoiding.** Don't overthink it. Don't wait for the perfect moment. Just begin and figure it out as you go.
2. **Experiment with mixed reality.** Use your phone or any AR app to overlay digital elements on physical creative work. See what happens when virtual meets real.
3. **Clean one neglected space.** Choose the place you've been avoiding. Clean it completely. Notice how it changes your relationship with that environment.

## **Looking Ahead**

Thomas visiting from Berlin next weekend‚Äîgoing to Schalke together, which should be great. Workshop preparation coming up, then heading to Frankfurt for the week. Lots of prep work ahead.

Sometimes the best weeks are the ones with clear, simple plans: friend visits, football, work preparation. The rhythm of routine punctuated by planned adventures.

---

## **The Starting Manifesto**

Every time you choose not to start something because of external expectations, you choose other people's comfort over your own growth. You choose trends over truth. You choose certainty over possibility.

The cost isn't just the specific thing you didn't try. The cost is the pattern of not trying. The habit of hesitation. The muscle memory of choosing safety over curiosity.

The Freigeist breaks this pattern one start at a time.

## **Closing Thought**

Week 33 reminded me that the most powerful insights often come from the simplest observations. Not every week needs to be packed with adventure or complex analysis. Sometimes the most profound thing you can do is work consistently, try something new, and reflect honestly on what's really holding you back.

*The difference between dreaming and doing is often just the decision to start without permission.*

If there's something you've been thinking about trying‚Äîthat creative project, that conversation, that experiment‚Äîmaybe this is your reminder that the perfect moment doesn't exist. There's only now and the choice to begin.

*What would you start today if you stopped waiting for the right conditions? The Freigeist knows that the right conditions are created by starting, not found by waiting.*

**‚ÄîS**

*P.S. - Sometimes the most spontaneous decisions create the most authentic content. This newsletter was born from an unplanned video reflection. Maybe there's power in doing things without over-preparing. Maybe the best insights come when you just begin.*
